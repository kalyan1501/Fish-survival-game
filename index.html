    <h2>Game Description</h2>
    <p>
      This game is set in a 3D aquarium, where the player controls a fish using the mouse.
      The objective is to eat food that appears randomly in the aquarium. Each time the
      fish eats, a new fish is born and starts moving randomly. If the player-controlled
      fish touches any of these randomly moving fish, the game ends. The score is
      determined by the number of food pieces eaten before the game ends.
